    How can one build a distributed secure social web using only Web Standards such HTTP, TLS, Linked Data and JavaScript? How can we escape the current silos and regain control of our digital life? How can we regain our identity? How can we help organisations co-operate without loosing their autonomy? This and more is what is enabled by the [Social Linked Data](https://github.com/linkeddata/SoLiD) architecture.
    Come and get your own data space, try out the slick web app demos from the [SoLiD team](https://github.com/orgs/linkeddata/people), and even learn to build new apps yourself!
