OuiShare Labs Camp code of conduct tl;dr:

**Be considerate and constructive, respectfully ask people to stop if you are bothered, and if you can't resolve an issue contact staff.**

OuiShare Labs events and spaces are aligned with **[OuiShare values >>](http://ouishare.net/en/about/values)**

## Inclusion &amp; Respect

OuiShare Labs Camp is an inclusive environment, based on treating all individuals respectfully, regardless of gender (including transgender status), sexual orientation, age, disability, medical conditions, nationality, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or software preferences.

We value respectful behavior above individual opinions.

## Interaction Style

- Be considerate, kind, constructive, and helpful.
- Try to understand different perspectives. Everybody has reasons for seeing things their way.
- Avoid demeaning, discriminatory, harassing, hateful, or physically threatening behavior, speech, and imagery.
- Empower others.
- Strive for excellence. OuiShare values permanent beta and action over talk, but this doesn't mean we should accept less than we can do.
- If you're not sure, ask someone instead of assuming. 

## Feedback &amp; Raising Issues

If you see someone behaving disrespectfully, you are encouraged to respectfully discourage them from such behavior. Expect that others in the community wish to help keep the community respectful and welcome your input in doing so.

If you experience disrespectful behavior and feel in any way unable to respond or resolve it respectfully (for any reason), please immediately bring it to the attention of an organizer. We will listen and work to resolve the matter.
